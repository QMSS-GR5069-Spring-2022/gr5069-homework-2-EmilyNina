# HW 8
### Met Museum API

Greetings! This is Emily!

Here is my Homework 8 for Modern Data Structure (QMSS GR5072).

In this homework, I tried to extract data by using API and created functions to help users get data easily.

The API I used here was to provide information about collections in Met Museum. It has four available endpoints: 
- Objects: a list of Object IDs
- Object: a recird for a particular object
- Departments: A list of valid departments
- Search: A list of Object IDs that contain a search query within the Object's data

Here is the base URL: https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org

And you can also check the API document by using this link: https://metmuseum.github.io/

Please feel free to play around the API and check out my function :)

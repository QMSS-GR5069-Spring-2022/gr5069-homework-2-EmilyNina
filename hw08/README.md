# HW 8
### Met Museum API

Greetings! This is Emily!

Here is my Homework 8 for Modern Data Structure (QMSS GR5072).

In this homework, I tried to extract data by using API and created functions to help users get data easily.

The API I used here was to provide information about collections in Met Museum. Please feel free to play around the API and check out my function :)
